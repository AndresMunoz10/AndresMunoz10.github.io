      <h1> Hi this is the About Me Page !</h1>

<p> My name is Andres Munoz and I attend Bronx Early College Academy.
I am a 16 yr old senior taking 2 classes for my favorite teacher Dr. O'Grady. 
<br>
I am also apart of his Robotics team along with my other friends and I'm in charge of building our
<br>
robot for the competition with the assistance of my great friend Donovan Delgado. Hello it's me from the future! 
<br>
I am now 17 and about to graduate from high school. My favoriate teacher is making me write more on this webspage 
<br>
so here I am! O'Grady is such a nice and chill person. When me and  the Robotics team were in the process of builiding 
<br>
a robot for the competition he would give us snacks and put on the World Cup which gave us a big
<br>
boost. Now that I am about to graduate I just want to say thanks to Oggie for teaching us this subject 
<br>
because it gave me the real world realizaiton I am probably not cut out for computer programmin of this kind of sort.
