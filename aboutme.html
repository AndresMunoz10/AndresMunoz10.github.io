      <h1> Hi this is the About Me Page !</h1>

<p> My name is Andres Munoz and I attend Bronx Early College Academy.
I am a 16 yr old senior taking 2 classes for my favorite teacher Dr. O'Grady. 
I am also apart of his Robotics team along with my other friends and I'm in charge of building our
robot for the competition with the assistance of my great friend Donovan Delgado. Hello it's me from the future! I am now 17 and about to graduate 
from high school. My favoriate teacher is making me write more on this webspage so here I am! O'Grady is such a nice and chill person. When me and  
the Robotics team were in the process of builiding a robot for the competition he would give us snacks and put on the World Cup which gave us a big 
boost.
