<p> 
My name is Andres Munoz and I attend Bronx Early College Academy. I am a 16 yr old senior taking 2 classes for my favorite teacher Dr. O'Grady. I am also apart of his Robotics team along with my other friends and I'm in charge of building our robot for the competition with the assistance of my great friend Donovan Delgado.
